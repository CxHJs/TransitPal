# TransitPal
A open source Swift app for iOS that allows you to check your NFC transit card information. Uses [Core NFC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc/) and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/).

Currently it only supports Clipper Card. More cards can be somewhat easily added, although support for any protocol other than MIFARE DESFire would need to be added first.

Database of stations is [provided by Metrodroid](https://github.com/micolous/metrodroid/tree/master/extra/mdst/#readme).
